# Mad-Ball
 
 

I wanted to challenge myself by making game in ONE WEEK so I made Mad Ball!

Mad ball is a game where player is controlling a ball throwing it into the flying objects. Drag mouse button to aim and release the mouse button to launch the ball in aimed direction. The launch force increased with the amount of drag.

Check out the 6 minutes gameplay video that covers up all the features I made or you can download and Play: https://parthvadera.itch.io/mad-ball
